					<h2>Beta Prototype</h2>
					<h2>Refinement of user manual or installation guide</h2>
					<p>Our user manual has been reviewed and updated with regards to the changes made since the alpha. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BLfO8qH_tffX6jKsmS2jRpfqWL6GdTnA/view?usp=sharing">User Manual</a></p>

					<h2>Design Evolution</h2>
					<p>From the many feedback we have received from testers, we have made design changes to the interactive interface. Here are some design changes performed to meet the usability criteria.</p>
					<p>The main introduction to the web service is a working data storage. This was blocking us from making the webpage to work as it is intended. With the storage, users can create new bills, see in the "Dashboard" their related bill cards, and able to look inside of bill they or others have created. This was the focus of our Beta Prototype.</p>
					<p>The user can interact with the bill in form of a card or full bill.</p>
					<p>In the "Bill Creation" page, we made changes regarding the </p>
					<p>In the "Registration" page, we have added additional fields for the user to add his/her first name and last name. Error messages are added to the page when same email is used or when the registration was not done successfully. There is also the addition of mandatory field that the user must enter for the registration to happen.</p>
					<p>In the "Login" page, we have added a missing field check and error messages being shown if wrong user email and/or password was entered.</p>
					<p>In the main dashboard, several changes were made to make a more pleasing interaction. </p>

					<h2>Prototype Revisions</h2>
					<p>Please note that we have changed the web server due to the lack of php service capability. <a href="http://18.221.54.159/BillSplittingServiceWeb/">New web link</a></p>
					<p>Please note that not all the feature is working as we did not have enough time to debug problems. There is a possibility of card missing after creating the bill.</p>
