					<h2>Design Concepts</h2>			
                <p>During the brainstorming we listed three major components of a bill splitting service. The Login/Registration section, the Individual Bill View/Creation section, and the List of all Bill section. We decided to treat these three sections as three individual Low-Fidelity prototypes with the following Usability goals.<p>
                <h1>Login/Registration</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>Remember Me</li>
                    <li>Password Reset</li>
                    <li>E-mail as Username</li>
                    <li>Basic contact information</li>
                    <li>Social media registration</li>
                    <li>Optional profile picture</li>
                    <li>Ability to register without payment method</li>
                    <li>Option to register multiple payment methods</li>
                    <li>Ability to edit profile information</li>
                    <li>Ability to delete account</li>
                    <li>Link to access profile from any page in website</li>
				</ol>
                <h1>Individual Bill view/Bill creation</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bill Information</li>
                    	<ul>
                    	<li>Cost</li>
                    	<li>Date of Creation</li>
                    	<li>Member Contribution</li>
                    	<li>Preferred Payment</li>
                    	<li>Text Description</li>
                    	<li>Category/group</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Add proof of bill</li>
                    <li>Add payers</li>
                    <li>Submit bills</li>
                    <li>Catagorize expenses into subgroups</li>
                    <li>Add descriptions to expenses/subgroups</li>
                    <li>Specify the contribution of each payer</li>
                    <li>Indicate if someone has paid</li>
                    <li>Comment section</li>
                    <li>Make the bill easily shareable and with a perma-link</li>				</ol>
                    
                <h1>List of Bills</h1>
                <ol>
                	<li>Create, modify, delete, hide a Bill</li>
                	<li>Sort bills by catagory</li>
                	<li>Search function</li>
                	<li>Option to pay quickly from the website</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Separating the Bill splitting service into three parts allowed us to focus on the main actions the user will need to do. Using the 10 + 10 method we came up with the sketches you see below:</p>
                    <object data="images/sketches/sketches.pdf" width="900px" height="700px"></object>
                <p>From these sketches we have found three themes. The Bubble design which organizes information in bubbles that can be moved around by gesture. The Text design which organizes bills as a list of tabs as one would sort a file drawer. And finally the Spreadsheet design which mimicks the popular spreadsheet template to organize the bills and expenses in those bills in tables. Then, made 3 pencil and paper prototypes that would embody these themes.
                    
                <h2>Prototypes</h2>
                <h1>Prototype 1 - The Bubble Design</h1>
                <h1>Prototype 2 - The Text Design</h1>
                <h3>Prototype 3 - The Spreadsheet Design</h3>
                	<p>The Spreadsheet design was inspired by traditional spreadsheets and Excel. The information is laid out methodically and precisely. It may be difficult to visualize the elements properly. This is a very cartisian solution.</p>
