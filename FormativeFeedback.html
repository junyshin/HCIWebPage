    <h2>Testing</h2>
    <p>For our Formative Feedback, we were assigned Memoire’s note taking application for testing. The 3 of us conducted a usability test with 3 users that we believe fit into the user population of Memoire’s application, 2 students and 1 recent graduate. We conducted the test in the McConnel cafeteria using a MacBook laptop. We followed the procedure outlined in the test script, administering all the tests provided in the task description to users. One subject (Test Subject 3) was unable to complete one of our additional tasks, but did complete all the tasks provided by the design team.
In addition to user testing, we performed a usability evaluation.

<h3>Feedback Analysis</h3>
<p>Over the course of the test, all threee users made similar critiques of the system. Moreover, the three test subjects found themselves struggling at the same steps in the test plan. This implies that the problems brought to light below would affect most of the potential userbase. One-off comments only made by one subject could also proved insightful. Even if these gripes were mostly about the overall feel of the website and not core functions, they should be addressed by the development team after more important issues are resolved. Listed below are the similiarities between the test subjects feedback and a list of differences in the feedback that only one member brought up but can serve helpful still.</p>
<h4>Similarities</h4>

<h4>Differences</h4>
	<ul>
    	<li>Injury prevented one user from typing.</li>
    	<li>Differences in typing speeds.</li>
    	<li>One subject attempted to use the video and audio reccording functionalities.</li>
    	<li>One subject attempted to use keyboard shortcuts to underline text, create a new note and navigate through files.</li>
    	<li>Different interpretations of the functions represented by images in create a Edit Note page.</li>
    	<li>Different ammount of time spending the user manual.</li>
	</ul>
    
    <p>All users found doing editorial work to be difficult. They are used to have a button next to bold and italic to underline parts of text. They are used to seeing a highlighter near these buttons to highlight a part of text. The editor in create a new note does not follow these typical text editing tropes. The system does not communicate with the users. All three subjects pointed out that they were unsure if they had properly saved their notes. Furthermore, they all paused when no mention of the files they were going to upload appeared. One user made heavy use of keyboard shortcuts and was disappointed when they would not work. Notably, this subject expected ctrl+n to create a new note and ctrl+s to save (or at least re-assure the user that the note is saved). Without these shortcuts users cannot get good at using this system and are limited by click speed. The team should introduce keyboard shortcuts to make the system more responsive to the real world time-constraints of note taking and to insure adept users get the most out of their system. Because of a hand injury one user wasn't able to type with their keyboard. Although not included in the scope of the test, potential functions such as reccord audio and video could have helped with note taking. All test subjects interpreted the images at the Edit note page differently. It needs to be made clearer what image corresponds to what function. Since the test subjects already take notes with their laptops it is safe to assume they are confortable with pre-existing text editing software and web pages. The team should take cues from established conventions in both these fields when designing their website to make sure the users are familiar with the interface. A prime example of this is the slider functions which no one understood on the first go, rather, they were familiar with directly inputting the time with their keyboard so they tried that first.
    
    
    User manual spent different ammount of time reading the user manual and the user that read it did not perform the tasks faster. Reading the user manual is then time wasted.</p>

    <h2>Test Plan Critique</h2>
    <p>Deeply testing the subfunctions (Text editing) and not the macro-functions. Guiding the user through the website instead of letting them figure it out. Giving the user the order of operations not letting them test the system properly. Add more recognition/recall test, can the user discern what these labels mean. Giving the user pre-written script not the same of taking notes which is done more on the fly. Should have teacher simulation where one of the experimenters pretends to be a teacher/colleague giving information and the user takes notes.</p>
    <h3>The system should not hinder any normal user activities</h3>
    <p>No stated task to evaluate “distractedness”. Ask users about the aesthetic in the post test-questionnaire.</p>
    <h3>The system should be easily understood by the user</h3>
    <p>Add explicit questions about their understanding to the post test questionnaire. Test the user at the end about what meant what.</p>
    <h3>The system should be effective at taking notes</h3>
    <p>Should be a note taking exercise that mimics real life situation better than editing a pre-written text. This can be done by making two quizzes, one for which they can use the note taking system the other for which they’re only allowed pencil and paper. The information will be presented like a mock-lecture and the user’s will fill in the information in the system.</p>
    
    <h2>Test Plan Improvement</h2>
    <p>Test Plan Improvement:
Reading through all the documents for testing the system to the users, we have found couple of features that were not explicitly accounted for. Here are some additional feature we have added to the test.

For their usability goal “<strong>The system should be easily understood by the user</strong>”, we have though to add the understanding icons present in the webpage. As the icons in questions are present in the most important part of the webpage (new note), we have added questionnaires asking user to explain in their own word what each icon ment to them. This was also to test if the users were able to remember the description written in the user manual as no descriptions were present on each icons on the webpage (quick reminder).

Reading through the test script and test description, we believed that there was no test that represented the usability goal “<strong>The system should be effective at taking notes</strong>”. As such, we have added a test to measure and compare the note taking ability on the webpage against a hand written test.  The test will consist of users listening to a text on two different country (Swaziland and Bouthan) with similar topics. After taking notes on each countries using one methods for each country, we would ask questions on each countries too see if there is a noticeable different between the two methods and receiving user feedback their thoughts.

We also noticed that there were no questions to test the usability goal “<strong>The system should not hinder any normal user activities</strong>”. As such, we have added questions 4 and 5 in the new post-questionnaire.</p>

   <h2>Design Critique</h2>
    <p>After user feedbacks and individual testing of the webpage, we have tabulated suggestions would enhance the user experience.</p>
    	<ol>
        	<li>Adding more informative information on the welcome page. One of the user have noted that, after logging to the webpage, the webpage looked to be unnecessary. After creating multiple events and notes, show the summary on the main page would be great to have.
</li>
        	<li>When in “<strong>New Note</strong>”, one user commented that there should be a way to classify the note. At the moment, we could create the note but there is no way to know where the note is saved or located.
</li>
        	<li>In the text editor, we all noticed that there was no way to know if the text we have wrote was saved or not. There were no visual queue or button to click. The addition of this could ease the tension created before closing or navigating the webpage.
</li>
        	<li>In the text editor, there was no way to know what the icons located at the bottom of the screen. An addition of a hint, such as small description or title when mouse is hovered over them would be a great addition.
</li>
        	<li>In “<strong>Create an Event</strong>”, when adding the time, users would try to type the time first but no input was possible. This would be a great addition. In addition to this, using the slider for the time was very confusion to the user as they were not used to using this. One comment by a user was “For the minute, an increment of 5, 10 or 15 minutes would be better as meeting was never made in a odd number.”
</li>
        	<li>In “<strong>Organize and Upload</strong>”, the user did not know how the “<strong>Tags</strong>” system worked. Some would put a comma “,” or a semicolon “;” to separate each tag. They also was questioning how the file(s) would be saved in the “<strong>My Files</strong>”. If each tag was a folder or a subfolder.
</li>
        	<li>In the “<strong>Organize and Upload</strong>”, when adding file(s) to upload, there did not know if the file was selected (no information was present under “<strong>Upload Files</strong>”). They also asked if the file was uploaded to the server after adding the file (they noted that normally the file is upload first before creating it). The upload bar after create confused them.
</li>
        	<li>In “<strong>My Files</strong>”, on the top left corner of the webpage, the “<strong>Main Menu</strong>” button should be much bigger and that it should resemble a button (was almost hidden in the background for one user).  One user commented that the navigation bar should be also present there for consistency. 
</li>
        </ol>
        
<h2>Usability Evaluation</h2>
   	<p>The Usability evaluation was carried out by the 3 members of the testing team prior to testing with users. We individually went through the system and noted any issues we had with the system. We then came together and grouped the issues we had under the recommended usability heuristics provided in the evaluation plan.</p>
