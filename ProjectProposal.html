					<h2>Illustrating a use of case scenario:</h2>
						<h4>Scenario 1:</h4>
						<p>
							A roommate is going for a grocery run and calls/asks its roommate what they want him/her to buy for them and for the house. This could be due to multiple factors: he/she is near the grocery store, on his/her way to buy food/snacks, or would like to buy something for himself/herself as such kindly asks the others. The buyer goes bad to the apartment and tries to split the bill according to eat roommates orders and apartment purchases. A more organised person would create multiple bills according to the roommates and apartment purchases. In the other hand, because of inconveniences (very long lineup, tired, other reasons), one massive bill was made for all the purchases. Now it has become more complicated to split the cost evenly as one person may have asked for nothing for himself/herself, but only needs to pay for the apartment purchases.
						</p>
						<h4>Scenario 2:</h4>
						<p>
							For the summer, one of the roommate is going abroad for school/internship. He/she does not want to pay for both housing due to expenses. As such, he/she comes to a conclusion with his/her roommates to sublet his room. To increase the chance for someone to sublet the room, he/she decides to pay for the internet bill for the next 4 months. This now becomes a logistic problem where the other roommate(s) must pursue multiple people for different recurring bills. The other side of the story could that he is no longer paying for the bills but his/her relative.
