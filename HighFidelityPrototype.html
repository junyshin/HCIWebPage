		<h2>Design Evolution</h2>
		<p>Based on out user feedback from our low-fidelity test(we thank the participants), we have norrowed down out webpage design and scope of service we should provide to the user.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>Design Change #1: Color</h4>
				<p> - users had trouble identifying elements and the status of the system. Feedback from the bubble prototype demonstrated their preference for colour indicators.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Design Change #2: Data entry simplified</h4>
				<p> – streamlined capture forms, the test users were confused by input fields in the card design. We combined the streamlined entry if the bubble design with the card design.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Design Change #3: New phrases</h4>
				<p> – some terminology was changed, to make it more clear what each element did. The visual elements on their own were not enough, proper labelling and clarification was needed.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Design Change #4: User orientation</h4>
				<p> – the feature walkthrough was added to the system because all tests showed that user was able to operate the system unassisted after they were familiar with the functionality.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Design Change #5: Visual supplements</h4>
				<p> – the bubble design was praised for its simplicity but it did not provide as much information as the card design. Our solution was to incorporate visual shorthand in the card design. This allows experienced users to quickly find information but provide new users with enough detail.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>User population</h2>
		<p>During our project proposal we developed 3 personas which encompass our intended user base. We decided to focus on students to keep the project focused. The characteristics we identified were the regular payer, the incidental payer and the payee.</p>
		<p>Our user population will consist of students looking to manage their bills and split expenses. Users who want to manage their funds will fall into the category of “payee”. The user who needs to occasionally split funds among friends/acquaintances will be known as an incidental payer and the user who regularly contributes to a fixed payment will be the regular payer. At least 2 users from each category should be tested, however one test subject can fall into different categories depending on the task.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="inner">
		<h2>Usability goals</h2>
		<p>We have carried forward some usability goals from our low fidelity prototype. The Navigation, Bill Listing, Bill Creation and Bill View still hold for our high fidelity prototype. We’re dropping the login/registration goal because the users encountered no issues with this feature, even when they were first exposed to the system. An additional usability goal we’re adding is Understanding. Following from the Low fidelity prototype testing, it is evident that the language and symbols used need to be as clear as possible for users to interpret their meaning. As such, understanding the meaning is an important new usability goal.</p>

			<li>Prior to the test observers should familiarize themselves with the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2zoYDh2mjDxNE9ZZnpoLUdaMmM" style="color:orange">Guidelines Document</a>. It provides, in detail, information on the requirements, environment, conduct and documentation required for testing our application, as well as answers to the questions listed above.</li>
			<li>Allow the user to read the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByUDpYxs2PcbdnNPWWhKZk5JZXc" style="color:orange">User Introduction</a> . Optionally, you may read the document to them.</li>
			<li>Go through the User manual with the user. At this point feel free to explain any functionality to the best of your ability.</li>
			<li>When the user is comfortable, proceed to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByUDpYxs2PcbLXpKY0JudHVYdmc" style="color:orange">Pre-test Questionnaire</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByUDpYxs2PcbdnNPWWhKZk5JZXc" style="color:orange">Consent Forms</a>. The observer should begin recording from this point onward.</li>
			<li>Begin the system demo. If the user requests to read the manual let them, otherwise the feature demonstration should be sufficient.</li>
			<li>You may now begin the tests. The order of the tests is up to you, please vary them from user to user. The only requirement is the Scenario test must be the last test. For detailed information on each test, please read the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByUDpYxs2PcbbjVEYWVDeHRZbUE" style="color:orange">Test Description Document</a>. The observer should remain silent during testing, the evaluator should provide the test description and only help when absolutely necessary.</li>
			<li>Give the user the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByUDpYxs2PcbYWpUakM1Ymo1eDg" style="color:orange">Post test Questionnaire</a>. Ask them directly if they have any final comments.</li>

		<h2>Reporting</h2>
		<p>The bulk of the information should be recorded to the Data Collection Sheet. The Observer should record any pertinent behaviour from the user, either through video or by taking notes. These observations should be added to the Data Collection Sheet after the testing session. The observer is primarily responsible for detailing the user’s subconscious behaviour.</p>
		<p>The pre-test questionnaire will be used to determine how our users currently track their expenses. It helps us gauge their expectations for the system. How do they currently solve this issue? Are they satisfied with their current solution or do they see room for improvement? Using this information we will be able to incorporate what the user views as essential into our system, and avoid the problems associated with their current bill splitting service.</p>
		<p>The post-test questionnaire serves as our qualitative feedback source. It lets us assess how satisfied the user was with our product. Were there elements they found surprising or useful? It lets us compare and contrast design choices directly. Was the information provided by the examiner/demo enough? This information lets us set clear goals and targets that we now will improve the product in our user’s eyes.</p>
		<p>The data collection sheet is our source if quantitative feedback. Plain and simple, it is the deciding factor in whether our system has met the usability goals we set out to achieve. The information provided by this sheet is a more objective measure on the performance of our system. This data can be used to track the progress of or system as we make changes, and whether those changes made a positive impact.</p>
