    <h2>Testing</h2>
    <h3>Test Plan Improvement</h3>
    <p>Test Plan Improvement:
Reading through all the documents for testing the system to the users, we have found couple of features that were not explicitly accounted for. Here are some additional feature we have added to the test.

For their usability goal “<strong>The system should be easily understood by the user</strong>”, we have though to add the understanding icons present in the webpage. As the icons in questions are present in the most important part of the webpage (new note), we have added questionnaires asking user to explain in their own word what each icon ment to them. This was also to test if the users were able to remember the description written in the user manual as no descriptions were present on each icons on the webpage (quick reminder).

Reading through the test script and test description, we believed that there was no test that represented the usability goal “<strong>The system should be effective at taking notes</strong>”. As such, we have added a test to measure and compare the note taking ability on the webpage against a hand written test.  The test will consist of users listening to a text on two different country (Swaziland and Bouthan) with similar topics. After taking notes on each countries using one methods for each country, we would ask questions on each countries too see if there is a noticeable different between the two methods and receiving user feedback their thoughts.

We also noticed that there were no questions to test the usability goal “<strong>The system should not hinder any normal user activities</strong>”. As such, we have added questions 4 and 5 in the new post-questionnaire.</p>
	<h3>Test Subjects</h3>
    <p>We have tested the system on three different test subjects. These subjects were students involved in different programs. We conducted the test in the McConnel cafetaria using a MacBook laptop.</p>
