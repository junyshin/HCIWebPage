					<h2>Beta Prototype</h2>
					<h2>Refinement of user manual or installation guide</h2>
					<p>Our user manual has been reviewed and updated with regards to the changes made since the alpha. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BLfO8qH_tffX6jKsmS2jRpfqWL6GdTnA/view?usp=sharing">User Manual</a></p>

					<h2>Design Evolution</h2>
					<p>From the many feedback we have received from testers, we have made design changes to the interactive interface. Here are some design changes performed to meet the usability criteria.</p>
					<table class="w3-table-all notranslate">
						<tr>
							<th>Changes</th>
					    </tr>
					    <tr>
					    	<td>In Beta prototype, our main focus was to make the back end data management to work as this connects every aspect of the web service such as creation a bill, viewing the view, interacting with the bill, and the login/registration system. The complexity of setting the data storage server and the stream lined coding took the bulk of the time. This hidden backend feature </td>
					    </tr>
						<tr>
							<td>The user can interact with the bill in form of a card in the Dashboard and in full bill view. This functionally was crucial as this is the main way to quickly view the bill and in detail.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>In the "Registration" page, we have added additional fields for the user to add his/her first name and last name. Error messages are added to the page when same email is used or when the registration was not done successfully. There is also the addition of mandatory field that the user must enter for the registration to happen.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>In the "Login" page, we have added a missing field check and error messages being shown if wrong user email and/or password was entered.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>When logged in, the user can see that he/she is logged in which did not did so in the Alpha prototype.</td>
						</tr>

					<p>User Interaction Documentation:</p>
					<p>From our volunteers, we have received feedback from our Alpha prototype. In the Bill creation page, one of the tester commented on the "Delete row" not letting him/her deleted the row it would like as the only way to correct this is to delete all the previous people or restarting from the beginning. In the Dashboard, the deletion of the card did not really delete the card it self as after refreshing the page, it was still present. Also he/she added that there should have been a notification double check the action. In the settings page, when the "Delete account" is clicked, there was no way to have a secondary check to not accidentally kill his or her account. The payment method does not function anymore in the card and it does show that the bill was paid by the payer or payee.</p>
					<p>We tried to get to all the comments from the feedback and testers but as stated before, our main focus on this prototype is the main functionality of the system. This mean the back end system to make the Dashboard, Bill Creation and Login system to work in unison for the user. Without this, usability would not have met and could not test the real interaction of the system.</p>

					<h2>Prototype Revisions</h2>
					<p>Please note that we have changed the web server due to the lack of php service capability. <a href="http://www.billsplittingwebservice.com/">New web link</a></p>
					<p>Please note that not all the feature is working as we did not have enough time to debug problems. There is a possibility of card missing after creating the bill.</p>
