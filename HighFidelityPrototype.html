		<h2>Design Evolution</h2>
		<p>Based on out user feedback from our low-fidelity test(we thank the participants), we have norrowed down out webpage design and scope of service we should provide to the user.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>Design Change #1: Color</h4>
				<p> - users had trouble identifying elements and the status of the system. Feedback from the bubble prototype demonstrated their preference for colour indicators.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Design Change #2: Data entry simplified</h4>
				<p> – streamlined capture forms, the test users were confused by input fields in the card design. We combined the streamlined entry if the bubble design with the card design.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Design Change #3: New phrases</h4>
				<p> – some terminology was changed, to make it more clear what each element did. The visual elements on their own were not enough, proper labelling and clarification was needed.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Design Change #4: User orientation</h4>
				<p> – the feature walkthrough was added to the system because all tests showed that user was able to operate the system unassisted after they were familiar with the functionality.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Design Change #5: Visual supplements</h4>
				<p> – the bubble design was praised for its simplicity but it did not provide as much information as the card design. Our solution was to incorporate visual shorthand in the card design. This allows experienced users to quickly find information but provide new users with enough detail.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>User population</h2>
		<p>During our project proposal we developed 3 personas which encompass our intended user base. We decided to focus on students to keep the project focused. The characteristics we identified were the regular payer, the incidental payer and the payee.</p>
		<p>Our user population will consist of students looking to manage their bills and split expenses. Users who want to manage their funds will fall into the category of “payee”. The user who needs to occasionally split funds among friends/acquaintances will be known as an incidental payer and the user who regularly contributes to a fixed payment will be the regular payer. At least 2 users from each category should be tested, however one test subject can fall into different categories depending on the task.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="inner">
		<h2>Usability goals</h2>
		<p>We have carried forward some usability goals from our low fidelity prototype. The Navigation, Bill Listing, Bill Creation and Bill View still hold for our high fidelity prototype. We’re dropping the login/registration goal because the users encountered no issues with this feature, even when they were first exposed to the system. An additional usability goal we’re adding is Understanding. Following from the Low fidelity prototype testing, it is evident that the language and symbols used need to be as clear as possible for users to interpret their meaning. As such, understanding the meaning is an important new usability goal.</p>

			<li>Prior to the test observers should familiarize themselves with the <span style="color:orange">Guidelines Document</span>. They provide, in detail, information of the requirements, environment, conduct and documentation required for testing our application.</li>
			<li>Allow the user to read the <span style="color:orange">User Introduction</span>. Optionally, you may read the document to them.</li>
			<li>When the user is comfortable, proceed to the <span style="color:orange">Pre-test Questionnaire</span> and <span style="color:orange">Consent Forms</span>. The observer should begin recording from this point onward.</li>
			<li>Begin the system demo. If the user requests to read the manual let them, otherwise the feature demonstration should be sufficient.</li>
			<li>You may now begin the tests. The order of the tests is up to you, please vary them from user to user. The only requirement is the Scenario test must be the last test. For detailed information on each test, please read the <span style="color:orange">Test Description Document</span>. The observer should remain silent during testing, the evaluator should provide the test description and only help when absolutely necessary.</li>
			<li>Give the user the <span style="color:orange">Post test Questionnaire</span>. Ask them directly if they have any final comments.</li>
			<li>Record any supplemental observations in the appropriate area on the data collection sheet.</li>

		<h2>Reporting</h2>
		<p>The bulk of the information should be recorded to the Data Collection Sheet. The Observer should record any pertinent behaviour from the user, either through video or by taking notes. These observations should be added to the Data Collection Sheet after the testing session. The observer is primarily responsible for detailing the user’s subconscious behaviour.</p>
