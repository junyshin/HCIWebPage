					<h2>Illustrating a use of case scenario:</h2>
						<h4>Scenario 1:</h4>
							<p>
								A roommate is going for a grocery run and calls/asks its roommate what they want him/her to buy for them and for the house. This could be due to multiple factors: he/she is near the grocery store, on his/her way to buy food/snacks, or would like to buy something for himself/herself as such kindly asks the others. The buyer goes bad to the apartment and tries to split the bill according to eat roommates orders and apartment purchases. A more organised person would create multiple bills according to the roommates and apartment purchases. In the other hand, because of inconveniences (very long lineup, tired, other reasons), one massive bill was made for all the purchases. Now it has become more complicated to split the cost evenly as one person may have asked for nothing for himself/herself, but only needs to pay for the apartment purchases.
							</p>
						<h4>Scenario 2:</h4>
							<p>
								For the summer, one of the roommate is going abroad for school/internship. He/she does not want to pay for both housing due to expenses. As such, he/she comes to a conclusion with his/her roommates to sublet his room. To increase the chance for someone to sublet the room, he/she decides to pay for the internet bill for the next 4 months. This now becomes a logistic problem where the other roommate(s) must pursue multiple people for different recurring bills. The other side of the story could that he is no longer paying for the bills but his/her relative.
							</p>
						<h4>Scenario 3:</h4>
							<p></p>
					<hr>
					<h2>Finding related products:</h2>
						<h4><a href="https://www.kittysplit.com/en/">KittySlipt:</a></h4>
							<p>
								KittySplit is a cross platform web application for tracking expenses across groups. The user creates a “kitty”,  a communal expense sheet and then shares it with the other users responsible for paying for the group activity. The application can also record transfers between users, allowing them to track and settle debts between each other. It comes with the ability to minimize transactions, resolving debt chains into the fewest possible transactions.
							</p>
							<p>
								However KittySplit has no accounts or users. This makes scheduling regular transactions between multiple difficult. The user would need to create an Kitty and invite people to it each time. This puts more pressure on the payee to coordinate payments when a bill is due. Another consequence of the accountless system is no in-app payment system. The system only tracks transactions. This means the payer and payee need a separate application to actually make the transaction.
							</p>
						<h4><a href="https://www.splitwise.com/">Splitwise:</a></h4>
							<p>
								Splitwise is a bill splitting service that can only be used with an account. There are two methods in making an account. There could be an dedicated account with Splitwise through them or can be made by using a Google+ account. This can simplify the creation process and help the user by having one account that can fit all. The service available through the web or by downloading an Android or IOS application. Each service is free of charge and account can be deleted at anytime. The bill splitting service lets the user to categories their purchases. The service also lets the user to upload pictures related to the bill and add descriptions. The associated users which will split the bill can add comments. For recurring bills, it lets the user set a repeat feature to the bill and a reminder feature as well. The service also lets the user to create multiple group for multiple activities.
							</p>
							<p>
								This service does not allow any money transfer and lets the users take care of this matter. A incident payer must create an account if they wish to participate in bill actions taking place. The user interface can become overwhelming as bills are created with very large icons and complicated messaging system.
							</p>
						<h4><a href="https://www.xoom.com/">Xoom</a></h4>
							<p>
								Xoom is a money transfer Paypal service application. It allows users to request money from other Xoom account holders. Once the transaction is complete, the users receive a confirmation. In addition to transfer requests, Xoom lets its users pay bills directly from the app. It allows users to save specific transactions, making it easier to schedule regular payments.
							</p>
								Xoom has some significant usability drawbacks. Xoom’s payment system only accounts for transactions between 2 people. This greatly limits the scope of the system, as a separate application would be needed to organize finances and track transactions during group activities. The application is also tied to the Paypal payment method. The transaction fees with this method can be prohibitive and limiting payment methods reduces potential users.
							</p>
						<h4><a href="https://venmo.com/">Venmo:</a></h4>
							<p>
								Venmo is a social media style money transfer application that allows users to connect with friends, split payments among each other and record transactions. Venmo allows users to make payments directly in the application, with a variety of payment methods available at no extra cost.
							</p>
							<p>
								Venmo’s application has some major usability issues. When receiving money, the money is stored in Venmo’s local currency. This restricts how users can spend the money they receive, forcing them to use the app for purchases. The system also stores the user’s payment credentials, which poses a potential security issue. Because Venmo handles the payments with an in-app currency, they are financially responsible for managing transactions. Several users have complained of transactions being blocked or transactions being denied, which would not be the case with e-transfer.
							</p>
						<h4>Traditional Spreadsheet:</h4>
							<p>
								The traditional approach to tracking expenses requires a pen, paper and spreadsheet application. The onus is on the payee to organize all the payers, collect all the money and pay the bill. The payers and payees meet together, with proof of purchase, and determine who payed for what product and who owes who money. A spreadsheet is used to tabulate the expenses.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is a poor system for tracking transactions, requiring physical receipts for impartial auditing, multiple systems to successfully complete transactions and all users need  to be present to complete the transaction.
							</p>

					<h2>Comparing Products:</h2>
						<p>
							The existing products are well made application but each has a significant flaw that would hamper our user’s experience. We aim to make a product that takes the best and most relevant elements from each of the available solutions and combine them to form the definitive transaction management system for students.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our product will offer in-app transactions through e-transfer and Paypal. This will solve the issue of needing several different applications and services to complete a transaction, which is present in Kittysplit, Splitwise and traditional spreadsheets. By offering both paypal and e-transfer we give our users more variety in their payment methods unlike Xoom which forces users to use Paypal. Finally by using e-transfer and Paypal, both trusted and quality services, we will avoid the issues encountered by Venmo.
						</p>
						<P>
							We will offer users the ability to create accounts and form groups. This will allow for transactions to take place between more than two people, a significant improvement over Xoom’s application. The groups will help organize payments between Regular payers and payees, providing the ability to schedule payments in advance and receive notifications for upcoming bills. This takes the onus of the payee when managing transactions, a significant improvement over Kittysplit, Xoom, Venmo and traditional spreadsheets, all of which require significant input on the payee’s part.
						</P>
						<P>
							Our system allows the payers and payees to upload proof of purchase when entering transactions. None of the existing systems offer a feature like this, instead requiring an implicit trust between payer and payee when entering a transaction. Our users are not necessarily as close as friends or family, meaning this trust will not always be present. Proof of purchase is essential for settling disputes among users. We will also have two way confirmation for transactions, allowing both the payer and payee to sign off on any exchange.
