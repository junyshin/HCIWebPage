        <h2>Design Evolution</h2>
        <h4>Usability Goals</h4>
        <p>Below is the recap of our uasiblity goals we have created to test our system to the users.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Navigation through menus</h4>
                <p>Navigating through the different menus of the system should not require explanation. The design should enable the user to navigate through menus and locate functionality unaided.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Listing of created bills</h4>
                <p>The user should be able to find and organize their bills. Scrolling through the list should be seamless and finding a target bill should be quick.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Creating a new bill</h4>
                <p>The system should streamline the process of creating bills. The user should be able to enter all the relevant information when creating a bill. The necessary information should be clear.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Viewing an existing bill</h4>
                <p>The system should provide a consistent source of information for both payer and payee. The status of the bill should be immediately clear to the user.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Understanding the system functionality</h4>
                <p>The meaning of pictorial and textual information should be simple to decipher. Users should be able to perform similar tasks without having them all fully demonstrated.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Here are design changes made according to the feedback we have received from the Social App team who have taken their time to test our system to 3 users.</p>
        <h4>Design change #1</h4>
        <p>According the users, they were having at first a great difficulty to distinguish what can be clicked and not as the buttons were not clear. Some buttons did not show on the webpage such as the "Add Row" and "Delete Row" button when the webpage is opened using FireFox. For this, we have changed the button type so that it can be viewed by any web browsers.</p>
        <h4>Design change #2</h4>
        <p>One the comments that was made by the Social App team is that there was no error prevention implemented in many parts of the website. The main complain was in the "Bill Creation" page where even if the user did not write all the fields, the user can create a bill. Due to this, we have implemented a check that will scan all the important fields. The user will be given a prompt on their screen on what is missing to complete the creation of a bill.</p>
        <h4>Design change #3</h4>
        <p>In the main page where we present a card of each bill present, the user commented that they had difficulty on how to view an existing bill. They did not know if the name of the bill was a link the entire card is a link. As such, we have changed the name link to card link. Now when the user hovers their mouse over the card, it glow blue and click anywhere on the card, the page of the bill will be shown.</p>
        <h4>Design change #4</h4>
        <p>On the task was for the user to quickly pay a bill. To do so, on the main page, the user just had to click on the pay blue button in the card. This will pop a secondary card with a payment methods the payee have chosen. One comment on this is that, there was no way to leave the card it the user miss clicked (when wanting to see that bill in more information). As such, we have added a close button at the top right of the card.</p>
        <h4>Design Change #5</h4>
        <p>In the bill creation page, the user add difficulty understanding how to add payers and how the amount the payee had to pay worked. Even though this information was present in the user manual, we have received a suggestion to add a description box (in a form a question mark icon) to inform the user. This was done as such. The "?" icon is placed right next to the add payee text for the user use if in though. This was also added in the main page when the user selects the "Sort By", information on the sort method information is given bellow it.</p>
        <h2>Prototype Revisions</h2>
        <p>The alpha version can be found at this <a href="http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~jshin22/BillSplittingServiceWeb">link</a>. Please refer to the manual for the password to access the webpage. If you have any issues please refer to the user guide below.</p>
        <h4>Observed problems from the project proposal:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Hard to keep track of who payed for what.</p></li>

        </ul>
        <h4>Functionality yet to be implemented:</h4>
        <p>We need to implement a data storage system for storing user specific data.</p>
        <h2>Refinement of user manual or installation guide</h2>
        <p>Here you can find the new version of the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iexAAF1DyPoEkd_WefO9OKMTLXl_UypB/view?usp=sharing">User Manual</a></p>
