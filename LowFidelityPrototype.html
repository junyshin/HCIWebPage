        <h2>Design Concepts</h2>
        <p>During the brainstorming we listed three major components of a bill splitting service. The Login/Registration section, the Individual Bill View/Creation section, and the List of all Bill section. We decided to treat these three sections as three individual Low-Fidelity prototypes with the following Usability goals.<p>
        <h1>Login/Registration</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Remember Me</li>
            <li>Password Reset</li>
            <li>E-mail as Username</li>
            <li>Basic contact information</li>
            <li>Social media registration</li>
            <li>Optional profile picture</li>
            <li>Ability to register without payment method</li>
            <li>Option to register multiple payment methods</li>
            <li>Ability to edit profile information</li>
            <li>Ability to delete account</li>
            <li>Link to access profile from any page in website</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Individual Bill view/Bill creation</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Bill Information</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Cost</li>
                <li>Date of Creation</li>
                <li>Member Contribution</li>
                <li>Preferred Payment</li>
                <li>Text Description</li>
                <li>Category/group</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Add proof of bill</li>
            <li>Add payers</li>
            <li>Submit bills</li>
            <li>Catagorize expenses into subgroups</li>
            <li>Add descriptions to expenses/subgroups</li>
            <li>Specify the contribution of each payer</li>
            <li>Indicate if someone has paid</li>
            <li>Comment section</li>
            <li>Make the bill easily shareable and with a perma-link</li>				</ol>

        <h1>List of Bills</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Create, modify, delete, hide a Bill</li>
            <li>Sort bills by catagory</li>
            <li>Search function</li>
            <li>Option to pay quickly from the website</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Separating the Bill splitting service into three parts allowed us to focus on the main actions the user will need to do. Using the 10 + 10 method we came up with the sketches you see below:</p>
        <object data="images/sketches/sketches.pdf" width="900px" height="700px"></object>
        <p>From these sketches we have found three themes. The Bubble design which organizes information in bubbles that can be moved around by gesture. The Card design which organizes bills as a list of tabs as one would sort a file drawer. And finally the Spreadsheet design which mimicks the popular spreadsheet template to organize the bills and expenses in those bills in tables. Then, made 3 pencil and paper prototypes that would embody these themes.</p>

        <h2>Prototypes</h2>
        <h1>Prototype 1 - The Bubble Design</h1>
        <p>The Bubble Prototype was made to be minimalist and pictorial. Bills are represented by bubbles, which can be reorganized by the user, and creating bill is more wizard-like as opposed to form entry. </p>

        <h1>Prototype 2 - The Card Design</h1>

        <p>The information on the card prototype was laid out on cards that showed the basics of the bill's information. These cards can be selected to view more information. Creating new bills adds more cards, and cards can be sorted into categories, discarded or hidden.</p>

        <h3>Prototype 3 - The Spreadsheet Design</h3>
        <p>The Spreadsheet design was inspired by traditional spreadsheets and Excel. The information is laid out methodically and precisely. It may be difficult to visualize the elements properly. This is a very cartisian solution.</p>

        <h2>Usability Goals</h2>
        <h1>Navigation</h1>
        <p> Navigating through the different menus of the system should not require explanation. We are aiming to simplify the transaction management process for students. The design should enable the user to navigate through menus and locate functions unaided. If the user is constantly asking for help or is unable to perform a simple action, then the design is hindering the functionality.
        </p>
        <h1>Login / Register</h1>
        <p>The user should be able to gain access to the application without assistance.
            Most user will be exposed to system through recommendations, or being added as a guest payee. It is important that a user’s first exposure to the system doesn’t dissuade them from registering. Registration itself should be simple and capture the relevant information.
        </p>
        <h1>Bill Listing</h1>
        <p>The user should be able to find and organize their bills. The bill listing should make it easy for the user to recognize what needs to be paid and who needs to contribute.  It is important that the user has a clear overview of their finances to have all the information in an easily understandable manner. Going through the list should be seamless and finding a target bill quick. </p>
        <h1>Bill Creation</h1>
        <p>The system should streamline the process of creating and tracking bills.
            Creating a bill should be easier than the existing alternatives. The process should allow the user to detail their expenditure, split the costs among friends and continually update the bill as payments are made.</p>
        <h1>Bill View</h1>
        <p>The system should provide a consistent source of information for both payer and payee. Making the individual bills clear and concise is paramount to the system, this is what they are going to be replacing their current bill format with. Users should be able to know exactly what they need to pay and why. Paying itself through the system should be a one-click task.</p>

        <h2>Summary of Test Results</h2>

        <h1>Bubble Prototype</h1>
        <b>Create Account</b>
        <p>Both users were able to easily create an account, No assistance was required at this step</p>
        <b>Check Bill</b>
        <p>Users found it easier to locate the rent bill because it was clearly labeled. Color coding the payees helped the user identify their status.
            Both users were successful in identifying the roommate who hadn't payed</p>
        <b>Create Bill</b>
        <p>Data entry fields being popups rather than always present, made data capture faster and clearer.
            Users weren't always able to discern them meaning of an icon and required clarification.
            User added guest when the bill was meant for roommates, it wasn't clear the icon was meant for a guest user</p>
        <b>Create Bill with Guest</b>
        <p>Both users were successful in adding a bill with a guest user</p>
        <b>Full Workflow</b>
        <p>The second time the users went through the workflow quicker and the users were notably more confident.
            This shows that the bubble prototype helps users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors.</p>
        <b>Feedback</b>
        <p>The Bubble prototype’s conceptual model was hard for users to understand. Navigation was rated poorly. Design was the most aesthetically pleasing and minimalistic.</p>

        <h1>Card Prototype</h1>
        <b>Create Account</b>
        <p>Users were able to find the register section quickly upon first use. One user would have liked option to connect using social media.
            One user wanted the registration to be separated from the login section.</p>
        <b>Check Bill</b>
        <p>Users found it easy to scroll through the list of cards. Users were unclear what the negative sign represented.
            One user was not sure how to get from the card list to the individual bill. Users were able to identify the roommate that hadn't payed their bill.</p>
        <b>Create Bill</b>
        <p>Users were confused with the guest user input field, they were not sure if it was mandatory or not. They were unsure about how to add payee's and specify their contribution
            After explaining how to add payees, both users were able to create a new bill.</p>
        <b>Create Bill with Guest</b>
        <p>As mentioned above, users were unsure about how to add guest payees.</p>
        <b>Full Workflow</b>
        <p>Both users were able to perform a full workflow unassisted.</p>
        <b>Feedback</b>
        <p>People responded well to the overall design.
            Users would prefer the cards to give more information at first glance. Second visual element needed to distinguish bills.
            Cards and text is clear but it needs to be supplement with graphic cues. Add small bubbles with payer faces (like facebook message). Color coding would help a lot.
            Making an individual bill required a lot of input from the user, bill creation process should be streamlined.
            Users were able to do all the tasks at a decent speed on the first try and they were very quick on the second time attempting the workflow.</p>

        <h1>Spreadsheet Prototype</h1>
        <b>Create Account</b>
        <p>Users wanted a clear login button, but were otherwise able to create an account and log in.</p>
        <b>Check Bill</b>
        <p>Too much information on screen. Users recognized the design but students did not need that much detail.
            They could not parse the information at a glance. One user was unsure where to click to access the bill and needed to shown the correct area.
            Users found the terminology of the header confusing.</p>
        <b>Create Bill</b>
        <p>When creating a bill, users did not know where to start - No clear place to put inputs and where they should go.
            Users were not sure where to click. Users thought they could modify values from bill list. </p>
        <b>Create Bill with Guest</b>
        <p>Users were not sure how to differentiate between adding guest users and adding regular users.
             Did not understand that only users registered in the system would get automatically notified and external users needed an extra step.</p>
        <b>Full Workflow</b>
        <p>After having the system features explained to them, both users were able to perform the full workflow.</p>
        <b>Feedback</b>
        <p>
            Did not need so much information about individual expenses.
            Detail was too much for students, more suitable for business users. Interactive areas were unclear</p>

        <h1>Design going forward</h1>
        <p>User was much quicker on the second pass. We should have a quick start guide to alleviate first-use speed bumps. Proof of payment may be superfluous.
            Focus on speed of making a new bill maybe by adding option to input more details later if needed. Maybe long-term (rent) vs short-term (night out) bill creation.
            We should use color. Users prefer to sort things by the names they give them and not macro-information like date of creation or value of the bill.
            Need to make distinct known contact vs guest user. Guest user information pop-up could alleviate drawback in card sort where user would not like to leave the guest user field blank.
            We should clear confusion between bills you created and bills you must pay. Without any guidance, users quickly feel overwhelmed.
            Makes sense to sacrifice flexibility for smoother user interface. Bill list and individual bill view should have separate layouts in order to prevent confusion between both.

            Going further we should keep doing iterative design on the card prototype. We will make the cards clearer by using elements from the bubble design users responded to.
            We can use the spreadsheet design as an example of design pitfalls to avoid. Notably: Putting too much information on screen, giving the users too many options and not guiding the user through the payment process.
            We have found that for our user base, we must concentrate on smooth webpage navigation and clarity of information on screen.</p>
